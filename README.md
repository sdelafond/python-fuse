# python-fuse #

This is a Python interface to libfuse
(https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).

* The API is described in ``README.new_fusepy_api``. It's an
  informative description, not a reference. Apart from that, see the
  examples and the actual code.

* Project home page is https://github.com/libfuse/python-fuse

* ``Changelog`` and ``README.new_fusepy_api.html`` are generated files
  and are only included in releases. Look into ``make_release.sh`` for
  seeing how they are made.
